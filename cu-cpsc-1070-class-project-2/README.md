How to use?
------
First of all, you have to compile the source codes using the following command:
```bash
make
```

Then, to test your program, simply run this command:
```bash
make test
```

Note: After you compile the source codes, you don't need to recompile it to get different test cases. You just need to run it again.

Custom Function
------
You just need to replace the recursiveFun.cpp file with your code.
